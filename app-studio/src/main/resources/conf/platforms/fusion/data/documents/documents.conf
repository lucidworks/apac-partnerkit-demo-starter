# # Define a mapping from the fields in your Fusion collection to a different information model or schema.
# # This allows you to change from one schema to another or change the way your documents are indexed in Fusion
# # without affecting the user interface. For example, suppose you have the fields title_txt and og_description_t
# # in your Fusion collection. Instead of referring to those fields in your views, you could instead map them to
# # more descriptive fields names, such as "title" and "description", using the following syntax:
# #
# #    aliases: title_txt=title,og_description_t=description
# #
# # All references to fields covered by the alias mapping will be updated, whether in results, facets, filters
# # or query strings.
# # aliases: title_s=title,og_description_t=description,fetchedDate_dt=date_indexed,id=url
